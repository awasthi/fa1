** Examples of metric spaces

*** The set of continuous functions $C[a, b]$
    With a metric $d(f, g) = \max\vert f(x) - g(x)\vert$

*** The space $l^p$ of sequences $x=(x_1, x_2 \cdots,)$ with $\Vert x \Vert _p < \infty$. 
    The metric is the norm of the difference. 

    To prove that this is indeed a metric, we need the Minkowiski inequality.

    There was a complicated proof of the Minkowski inequality that was discussed
    in the lecture. I think one can prove in a simpler fashion. 

    The proof involved showing that $\alpha \cdot \beta \le \alpha^{p}/p +
    \beta^{q}/q$ (This is the young inequality.)

    The next step was to prove the Holder inequality. 

    The next step is to use Holder on Minkowski. 

    Holder: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6lder%27s_inequality]]

    Minkowski: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_inequality]]

    For $p=q=2$, we obtain the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 

** Definitions involving metric spaces

*** Open ball
    $B(x_0, r)$ is the set of all points $x$ such that the distance from $x$ to $x_0$ is less than $r$.

*** Closed ball
    Similar to open ball, except that the distance can be less than or /equal to/ $r$.

*** Sphere
    The set of all points $x$ such that the distance from $x_0$ to $x$ is exactly $r$.

*** Relation
    If we subtract a sphere from the closed ball, we get the open ball.

*** Definition of open
    For every point $x$, we can find an epsilon ball that is inside the set. 

*** Definition of closed
    Basically the complement of the set is open.

*** Remark ($\varepsilon$ neighbourhood)
    An open ball $B(x_0, \varepsilon)$ of radius $\varepsilon$ is often called
    an $\varepsilon$ neighbourhood. A neighbourhood of $X$ is that contains an
    $\varepsilon$ neighbourhood of $X$

    We will use these definition for separable spaces.

*** Interior point 
    We call $x_0$ an interior point if there exist an neighbourhood of $x_0$
    contained inside the space.

*** Continuity
    About a function from one metric space to another. It's basically the
    standard definition. (the definition in the lecture was an $\varepsilon$,
    $\delta$ definition.) 

    The definition was about continuity at a point $x$. Then a function is
    defined to be continuous if it is continuous at every point $x$.

*** Accumulation point
    $A$ be a subset of $X$. Then $x_0 \in X$ (not necessarily in $A$) is called
    accumulation point of $A$ if every neighbourhood of $X_0$ contains at least
    one point $y \in A$, $y \neq x_0$.

  [fn:1]
** More definitions
*** Closure of a set
*** A dense subset of $X$
*** Separable
    If there is a countable subset that is dense in $X$. $X$ is defined to be
    separable.

    Example:
    1. Real numbers are separable.
    2. $l^p$ for $1 \le p \le \infty$ is separable.
    3. $l^\infty$ not separable. Proof idea: For any set of indices $I\subset
       \N$, define $(e_I)_n$ is $1$ is $h\in I$ and $0$ otherwise. For every $I
       \neq y$, we can compute the distance $d(e_I, e_J) = 1$. How many such
       functions are there? The number of such elements are uncountable. (The
       proof of this theorem is similar to how $\{0, 1\}^\N$ is uncountable.)[fn:2]
*** Definition of convergence
    Definition was about the limit of distance going to 0. Note that the limit
    $X$ must be a point in $X$ (Why?)
*** Definition of bounded set
*** Definition of boundedness of a sequence
*** Lemma
    If $x_n$ is convergent, then it is bounded the limit is unique.
*** Lemma
    If $x_n$ converges to $x$ and $y_n$ converges to $y$, then $d(x_n, y_n)$
    converges to $d(x, y)$.
*** About convergence and Cauchy sequences
*** Completeness
    The idea that if a sequence is Cauchy, then it is convergent.
*** Theorem about subsets of complete metric space
    $X$ be a metric space. A subspace $A$ of $X$ is complete if and only if $A$ is closed in $X$.
*** Condition about continuity with respect to convergence
    A map $T\colon X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous if and only if $x_n
    \rightarrow x_0 \implies T(x_n) \rightarrow T(x_0)$.
*** Definition of isometry between metric spaces
** Theorem: $C[a, b]$ is complete
   Given a closed interval $[a, b]$, the $C[a, b]$ is complete. 
*** Proof
    Given a Cauchy sequence in this space. We use the completeness of $\R$ to
    define a function to which the Cauchy sequence will converge to. We need
    uniform convergence here.
** The set of polynomials on a $[a, b]$ is not complete
   $p_n(x) = \sum_i \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^i$. 

* Lecture 4 <2018-10-25 Thu>
** Clarification
   Some sources say that an Isometry need not be surjective. 

   Let $T\colon X \rightarrow Y$ be injective and $d(x, y) = \tilde{d}(Tx, Ty)
   \forall x, y \in X$.

   Then $T$ is called isometry (from $X$) into $Y$. 

   A couple of examples of isometry were discussed. 

   Also we talked about uniform convergence, and also an example of a sequence
   that is not uniformly convergent was also discussed. (The idea is that on a
   compact set [fn:3], if a uniformly convergent function converges to a
   function is continuous.)

   Recall that we have already shown that $C[0, 1]$ is a complete space, meaning
   that if a sequence is Cauchy, then it has a limit in the space. Which means
   that the limit must also be continuous. (Kinda similar to how uniform
   convergence works.)
** Normed spaces and Banach spaces
   A Banach space is just a complete normed space.
*** Norm
    A metric space can be obtained by equipping a vector space with a metric
    defined in terms of the union, resulting in the *normed space*. Complete
    normed spaces are called *Banach space*.

    A mapping from one normed space to another is called an *operator* ($T\colon
    X \rightarrow Y). A mapping from a normed space to $\R$ is called a
    *functional* ($T\colon X \rightarrow \R$)

    It can be shown that a linear operator is continuous if and only if it is
    bounded.

    The set of all bounded linear operators from a space $X$ to a space $Y$ is
    again a normed space.

    Similarly, the set of all bounded linear functionals is a normed space, the
    dual space $X'$ of $X$.
*** Vector space
    I didn't write this down. But it's pretty clear. 
*** Examples
    1. $\R^n$
    2. $C[a, b]$. It's kinda clear how to define a vector space structure on it. 
*** Subspace
    We defined a subspace of a vector space. 
*** Span
    Span was defined.
*** Linear independence
*** Definition of dimension
*** Basis of space
    To construct basis for finite dimensional spaces are clear. 

    One can prove the existence of a basis for infinite dimensional spaces, but
    the proof is not constructive.
** Normed spaces
*** Definition of a norm
*** Examples
    1. $\R^n$
    2. $C[a, b]$ with $\Vert f \Vert$ with $\Vert f\Vert = \max_{x \in [a, b]}
       \vert f (x) \vert$. Is also a Banach space.
    3. $\Omega \in \R^n$ be a measurable set, then the space $L^p(\Omega)$ is
       the set of all Lebesgue measurable functions from $\Omega \rightarrow
       \R$. We can define the norm in a straightforward manner.

       We can show that this space is a Banach space.
* Lecture 5 <2018-10-30 Tue>
** Remark
   Not every metric is induced by a norm.

   Assume discrete metric is induced by a norm, i.e., $d(x, y) = \Vert x -
   y\Vert$. The proof is easy.
** Convergence of sequences in normed spaces
   1. A sequence $(x_n)$ in a normed space $X$ is convergent if there is an $x\in
      X$ with $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \Vert x_n - x\Vert = 0$. We write again
      $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} x_n = x$.
   2. A sequence is called a cauchy sequence if for all $\epsilon > 0$, there
      exists $N$, $\Vert x_m - x_m \Vert < \epsilon$ for all $m, n > N$. [fn:4]
** Absolute convergence
   A series $S$ is called absolutely convergent if $\sum \Vert x_i \Vert$
   converges. If $X$ is complete, absolute convergence implies convergence.

   Example 1. The alternating sum $\sum (-1)^n/n$ is convergent, but not
   absolutely convergent. This converges to $-ln(2)$.

   Example 2. $X = \Q$, $a_n = \sum \left(\frac{1}{2^{i}} -
   \frac1{(i+1)!}\right)$. The first part converges to $1$. The second element
   converges to $e-2$. The total is $3-e$. Let $b_n$ be $\sum
   \frac{-1}{(i+1)!}$. This converges to $2 - e$. Now $a + b = 5 - 2e$. $a - b =
   1$. One of them converges to an element in $\Q$ whereas the other one does
   not convert to an element in $\Q$. Now we construct a new sequence with one
   element from the first one and the next element from the second one and
   continue doing this $(a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \cdots)$. $S_n$ will be the partial
   sums. Then $\sum x_i$ converges to $a+b$, but $\sum \vert x_i \vert $
   converges to $a - b = 1$.
** Definition of basis
   We can now define a basis as follows: Assume that the normed space $X$
   contains a sequence $(e_n)_n$. Such that every $x \in X$ in the normed space
   $X$, can be expressed in terms of $(e_n)_n$, i.e., every $x$ can be expressed
   as a weighted combination or linear sums of $(e_n)_n$. $\Vert x - \sum
   \alpha_i e_i \Vert \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ and this
   expansion is also unique.

   If such a basis exists, then $X$ is separable.
** Theorem about completeness
   Every finite dimensional subspace $Y$ of a complete normed space $X$ is
   complete, which implies that all finite dimensional normed spaces are
   complete. [fn:5]
** Norm equivalence
   We have two norms. We want to say when two norms are equivalent.

   A norm $\Vert \Vert_1$ on $X$ is said to be equivalent to a norm $\Vert
   \Vert_2$ if there exists $a, b > 0$ such that

   $a \Vert x \vert_1 \le \Vert x \vert_2 \le b \Vert x \Vert_2$.

   An example: For finite-dimension vector space, then all norms are equivalent.

   We'll show that $\Vert \Vert_2$, and $\Vert \Vert_\infty$ are equivalent.

   Given any $X \in \R^n$, $\Vert x\Vert_2^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 \ge \max_i
   x_i^2 = \Vert x\Vert_\infty$. Also $\Vert x \Vert_2^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2
   \le n \cdot \max x_i^2 = n \Vert x \Vert_\infty$. Thus $\Vert x \Vert_\infty
   \le \Vert x\Vert_2 \le \sqrt{n}\Vert x \Vert_\infty$.

   *A non-example*: Consider $X = C[0, 1]$ and define $f_n(X) = X^n$. Clearly,
   $f_n \in C[0, 1]$ for al l$n$.

   $\Vert f_n \Vert_\infty = \max_{x\in [0, 1]} \vert f_n(x)\vert$. Now we
   introduce another norm which is the Lebesgue integral. For $f_n$, this would
   evaluate to $1/{n+1}$. The contradiction is the fact that the maximal norm
   would be $1$ always, whereas, the Lebesgue norm would tend to $0$ as
   $n\rightarrow \infty$. There is a clear contradiction here.
** Compactness in metric spaces
   A metric space is defined to be compact if every sequence in $X$ has a
   convergent subsequence. A subset $M$ of $X$ is defined to be compact if $M$
   considered as a subspace is compact, i.e., every sequence has a convergent
   subsequence and the limit is in $M$.
** Theorem
   If $X$ is a fininte-dimensional normed space, then any subset $M \subset X$
   is compact if and only if $M is closed and bounded.

   Consider the sequence $\{x_n\}$ with $x_n = (-1)^n$, then $(x_n)$ does not
   converge, but it has convergent subsequences.
** Bolzano-Weistrass theorem
   Any bounded sequence $(x_n) \in l^{\infty}$ has a convergent subsequence.
*** Proof
    Without loss of generality, we assume that all elements are with $[0, 1]$,
    otherwise we an shift it and normalize it (can we do this?) Divide the
    interval $\{0, 1/2\}$ and $\{1/2, 1\}$, then one of them must have
    infinitely many points. (We can repeat the argument), we have a new sequence
    which are elements of $x_n$ that are in the interval (the interval with
    infinitely many points.) We can repeat this process again and the length of
    the intervals go to zero. It is clear how to construct a convergent
    subsequence.
*** Extension to bounded sub-sequences in $\R^n$.
* Lecture 5 <2018-11-01 Thu>
** Review
   In $\R^n$, the compact subsets are the closed and bounded subsets so that
   close-ness and boundedness can be used to define compactness. This can only
   be used for finite dimensional cases.
** Riesz's lemma
   Given a normed space $X$ with a closed subspace $y$ and a subspace $z$ such
   that $y$ is a subset of $z$. Given any number $\theta\in (0, 1)$, there
   exists, $z\in Z$ such that $\vert z \vert = 1$, and the distance $\Vert z - y
   \Vert \ge \theta$, for all $y \in Y$.
*** Proof
    Let $v\in Z \textminus Y$, define $a = \inf_{y \in Y} \Vert v - y\Vert$ to
    be the distance to $y$. Since $y$ is closed, $a>0$. Choose $\theta \in (0,
    1)$, then there exits a $y_0 \in y$, with $a \le \Vert v - y_0 \Vert \le
    \frac{a}{\theta}$.

    Define $z = \vert{1}{\Vert V = y_0}(V-y_0)$. Clearly, $\Vert z\Vert = 1$.
    Furthermore, given $y\in Y$, it holds that $\Vert z - y\Vert =
    \Vert\frac{1}{\Vert v - y_0\Vert}(v -y_0) - y\Vert = \frac{1}{\Vert v -
    y_0\Vert} \Vert v - y_0 - \Vert v-y_0\Vert\cdot y\Vert$.

    Since $Y$ is a subspace, $y_1 \in Y$ and $\Vert v - y_1\Vert \ge a$ (since a
    is the infimum.)

    $\Vert z - y\Vert = \frac{1}{\Vert v - y_0\Vert} \Vert V - y_1\Vert \le
    \frac{\theta}{a}a = \theta$
** Theorem 
   If the closed unit ball $M=\{X \vert \Vert X \Vert \le 1\}$ of a normed space
   $X$ is compact, then $X$ is finite-dimensional.

   The proof uses Riesz's lemma. Assume that $M$ is compact set but $\dim X =
   \infty$, this leads to a contradiction. Compact sets have compact images
   under continuous mappings.
** Theorem
   Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are metric spaces and $T \colon X \rightarrow X$ is
   continuous. Then any compact subset of $X$ is mapped to a compact subset of
   $Y$.
*** Proof
    Proof is easy.
** Corollary
   Given a continuous mapping $T \colon M \rightarrow \R$, where $M$ is a
   compact subset of $X$. Then $T$ assumes a maximum and a minimum at some
   points of $M$.
*** Proof
    The proof is easy. It's something like take the infimum, it has to be a
    point in the space because closed.
** Example
   The closed unit ball $M=\{f \colon \Vert f \Vert \le 1 \}$ of $C[0, 1]$ is
   not compact. To see this, define $f(X) = \max(1 - \vert X \vert, 0)$ and
   $f_n(X) = f(2n\cdot (n+1)(x - \frac{1}{n}))$ (functions with center $1/n$ and
   decreasing bandwidth converges to the zero function) [fn:6]

   Now $f_n \in C[0, 1]$ and $\Vert f_n \Vert_\infty = 1$. Since supports of $f_n$ do not overlap.

   $\Vert f_n f_m\Vert = \max_{X \in \{0, 1\}} \vert f_n(X) - f_m(X)\vert = 1$
   and the sequence does not have a convergent subsequence.
** Linear Operators
   We now consider linear operators and their properties.
*** Definition
    Let $T$ be an operator, $D(T)$ its domain and $R(T)$ its range. The operator
    is called linear if $T(x + y) = Tx+Ty$ and $T(\alpha x) = \alpha Tx$

    Note that we typically write $Tx$ and not $T(x)$ as it is done for functions.

    The null set $N(T)$ is defined $N(T) = \{x \in D(T) \colon Tx = 0\}$

    In particular, linearity implies $T0 = 0$.
*** Example
    Define $T$ by $(Tf)(x) = \int_{a}{x} f(\tilde x) d \tilde x$ for $f\in C[a,
    b]$. Then $T(cf + cg) = cTf + dTg$. It is easy to show that the operator is
    linear.
*** Example
    1. Let $X$ be the space of all polynomials defined on $[a, b]$. We can define a
       linear operator to be the derivative, $Tf = f'$. [fn:7]
    2. Given $A \in \R^{m\times n}$, $T \colon \R^n \rightarrow \R^m$, $X
       \righarrow Ax$ is linear $T(ax + by) = aAx + bAy = aTx + bYy$.
    3. Let $k$ be a square-integrable function on $[a, b]^2$ and $X=L_2[a, b]$,
       then define $f\mapsto\int_{a}^{b} h(x, \cdot) f(x)\ dx$[fn:8] [fn:9]
** Theorem about linear operators
   Suppose that $T$ is linear, then
   1. $R(T)$ is a vector space
   2. $N(T)$ is a vector space.

   I think $R$ and $N$ are range and kernel, respectively. The proof is kinda
   easy.
* Lecture 6 <2018-11-06 Tue> 
** Regarding convergence of a function
   $\sup(f_n)\subset [0, 2/n]$, $f_n(0) = 0$, consider fixed $x\in [0, 1]$.
   Given any $\varepsilon > 0$, choose $N > 2/X$, then $X > 2/N > 2/N$ for
   $n>N$. Thus $x \in \sup(f_n)$ and $f_n(x) = 0$, $f_n$ converges point-wise to
   $0$.

   $f_n(x) = f(2n(n+1)(x - 1/2))$
** Injectivity of operators
   If $T$ is injective, there exists $T^{-1}\colon R(T) \rightarrow D(T)$ with
   $T^{-1}y =x$ for $Tx =y$, i.e., the inverse of $T$. It follows that $T^{-1}Tx
   = T^{-1}Ty = x$ and $TT^{-1}y = Tx = y$.

   Example: Given $A\in \R^{n\times n}$, $T\colon \R^n \rightarrow \R^m$, $x
   \mapsto Ax$.

   If $m < n$, $T$ can be injective if the rank of $A = n$, but it cannot be
   surjective. When $m > n$, then $T$ can be surjective, when the Rank of $A =
   m$, but it cannot be injective. If $m = n$, then $T$ is bijective if and only
   if the rank of $A = m = n$.
** Theorem
   Given vector spaces $X$ and $Y$, and a linear operator $T \colon D(T)
   \rightarrow Y$, then
   1. $T^{-1}\colon R(T) \rightarrow D(T)$ exists if and only if $T(x) = 0
      \implies x = 0$, i.e., the null space $N(T) = 0$. Then $T^{-1}$ is also a
      linear operator.
   2. If the dimension of the domain of $T$ is smaller than $\infty$, and
      $T^{-1}$ exists, then $\dim R(T) = \dim D(T)$.
*** Proof
    Assume that $T^{-1}$ exists then $T$ is injective and $Tx = 0 \implies x =
    0$. Conversely, assume $Tx_1 = Tx_2$, then $Tx_1 - Tx_2 = T(x_1 - x_2) = 0$.
    Thus, by assumption $x_1 - x_2 = 0 \implies x_1 = x_2$ and $T$ is injective.
    Hence the inverse $T^{-1}$ exists.

    To show that $T^{-1}$ is a linear operator: Given $y_i = T x_i$ and $x_i =
    T^{-1}y$, for $i = 1, 2$, then it follows that $T(\alpha x_1 + \beta x_2) =
    \alpha T x_1 + \beta T x_2 = \alpha y_1 + \beta y_2$ and $T^{-1}T(\alpha
    x_1 + \beta x_2) = T^{-1}(\alpha y_1 + \beta y_2)$. From this one can show
    that if $T^{-1}$ exists, it is also a linear operator.

    1. Let $\dim D(T) = n < \infty$, then $\dim R(T) \le n$, i.e., $\dim R(T)
       \le \dim D(T)$. This can be seen as follows: choose $n+1$ elements $y_1,
       \cdots, y_{n+1} \in R(T)$ and we choose them arbitrary, then we can find
       pre-images $x_1, \cdots, x_{n+1}\in D(T)$, it holds that $Tx_i = y_i$,
       for all $i$. Since we assumed $\dim D(T) = n$, the $x_i$ are linearly
       dependent, i.e., there exist $\alpha_i \in \R$ such that $\sum \alpha_i
       x_i = 0$ where not all $\alpha_i$ are zero. Now $T \sum_i^{n+1} \alpha_i
       x_i= \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \alpha_i y = 0$, but not all $\alpha_i$ are zero.
       Thus we have found a set of linearly dependent vectors. Since we chose
       the vectors arbitrarily, we see that the dimension must be less than or
       equal to $n$.

       If we apply the same reasoning to the inverse operator, which we assume
       exists, we obtain in similar fashion that the $\dim D(T) \le \dim R(T)$.
       Thus, $\dim R(T) = \dim D(T)$.
** Lemma
   Let $X, Y, Z$ be vector spaces $T \colon X \rightarrow Y$, and $S \colon Y
   \rightarrow Z$ bijective operators, then we claim that $(ST)^{-1} = T^{-1}
   S^{-1}$.
** Definition: Bounded operators
   Given normed spaces $X$ and $Y$ and a linear operator, $T \colon D(T)
   \rightarrow Y$, $D(T) \subset X$, $T$ is defined to be bounded if there
   exists a constant $c$ such that $\Vert Tx \Vert \le c \Vert x \Vert$ and this
   has to hold for all $x \in D(T)$. A bounded linear operator maps bounded sets
   in $D(T)$ onto bounded sets in $Y$.

   We define the norm $\Vert T \Vert = \sup_{x \in D(T), \lambda \neq 0}
   \frac{\Vert T x \Vert}{\Vert x \Vert}$ to be the norm of $T$. It is
   straightforward to verify that this satisfies the properties for norm.

   For bounded linear operators, the bound can be computed by the supremum over
   $\Vert x \Vert = 1$. This is straightforward to see.
** Example
   Given $A \in \R^{n \times n}$, the linear operator $T \colon \R^{n}
   \rightarrow \R^{n}$ is bounded since $(\sup_{\Vert x \Vert= 1} \Vert A x
   \Vert)^2 = \sup x^{T} A^{T} A x = \lambda \max(A^T A)$, the largest
   eigenvalue of $A^{T}A$ (Rayleigh-Ritz theorem.)

   Note that for $A = U \sum V^T$, so that $A^{T} A = V \sigma^2 V^{T}$, thus
   $\lambda_{\max} = \delta_{1}^2$, where $\delta_1$ is the largest singular
   value of $A$.

   Let $X$ be the space of all polynomials on $[0, 1]$ and $\Vert f \Vert =
   \max_{x \in [0, 1]} \vert f (x) \vert$. The differentiation operator $T$ with
   $Tf = f'$ is not bounded. Since for $f_n(x) = x^n$, $\Vert f_n\Vert = 1$, all
   these functions are bounded above by $1$, hence the norm is $1$, whereas, the
   norm of the derivative is $n$ and this is unbounded.

   $T \colon C[0, 1] \rightarrow C[0, 1]$ by $(Tf)(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(t)\ dt$.
   Then $\Vert T f\Vert = \max_{x \in [0, 1]} \vert \int_{0}^{1} f(t)\ dt\vert
   \le \max_{x \in [0, 1]} \int_{0}^{1} \vert f(t) \vert dt \le (1-0) \max_{x\in
   [0, 1]} \vert f(x) \vert = \Vert f \Vert$, thus $\Vert T \Vert \le 1$, but we
   can choose the function identical to $1$, then the norm is exactly equal to
   $1$.

   Define $c = \{x_n \in l_1 \vert \exits N \in \N\colon x_n = 0, \forall n >
   N\}$, with the $l_1$ norm. We define the operator $T\colon (x_1, x_2, x_3,
   \cdots) = (x_1, 2x_2, 3x_3, \cdots)$ is unbounded, we can compute $\Vert T
   e_i \Vert = i$, so if we have the sequence but the $\Vert e_i \Vert = 1$.
** Theorem
   Every linear operator on a finite dimensional normed space is bounded.
*** Proof
    Let $n$ be the dimension of $X$ and $\{e_1, \cdots, e_n\}$ a basis.

    Any $x\in X$ can be written as $X = \sum \alpha_i e_i$, thus $\Vert Tx \Vert
    = \Vert T \sum \alpha_i e_i\Vert \le \sum \Vert T \alpha_i e_i\Vert = \sum
    \vert \alpha_i \vert \le \max_{i} \Vert T e_i \Vert . \sum \vert \alpha_i
    \vert$. We define $\Vert x \Vert_0 = \sum \vert \alpha_i \vert$ defines a
    norm. Since all norms on finite-dimensional spaces are equivalent, there
    exist $c$ such that $\Vert x \Vert_0 \le c \Vert x \Vert$. Thus $\Vert T
    x\Vert \le \max \Vert T e_i \Vert \cdot c \cdot \Vert x \Vert$ and $T$ is
    bounded.

** Theorem about Bounded operators
   For linear operators, continuity and boundedness are equivalent.

   Continuity of $T$ means that $\forall \varepsilon > 0$, there exists a
   $\delta > 0$, such that $\Vert x - x_0 \Vert < \delta \implies \vert Tx -
   Tx_0 \vert < \varepsilon$.
*** Proof
    There is nothing to show for $T=0$, now we assume that $T$ is not the zero
    operator, i.e., $\exists r$ such that $\Vert T x \Vert \le r \Vert x \Vert$.
    Using linearity, we can write that $\Vert Tx - Tx_0\Vert = \Vert T (x -
    x_0)\Vert \le \delta \Vert x - x_0\Vert$. Choose $\delta =
    \varepsilon/\delta$, thus $\Vert x -x_0 \Vert < \delta \implies \Vert Tx -
    Tx_0 \Vert \delta \Vert x - x_0\Vert\le \gamma\cdot \delta =\varepsilon$ and
    $T$ is continuous.

    Conversely, assume that $T$ is continuous. Take arbitrary $y\in D(T)$,
    define $X = X_0 + \frac{\delta}{\Vert y \Vert} y$. Thus $\Vert x - x_0 \Vert
    = \Vert \frac{\delta}{\Vert y \Vert} \cdot y \Vert = \delta$. Since $T$ is
    continuous, $\Vert Tx - Tx_0 \Vert < \varepsilon$. Now $\Vert Tx - Tx_0\Vert
    = \Vert T \delta/\Vert y \Vert y \Vert = \frac{\delta}{\Vert y \Vert}\Vert T
    y \Vert < \varepsilon$ Multiplying by $\Vert y \Vert / \delta$, we get
    $\Vert T y \Vert < \varepsilon/\delta$\cdot \Vert y \Vert$ We call the last
    term $\gamma$.

    The second part of the proof shows that continuity in one point suffices to
    show boundedness. And boundedness means continuity at all points. Thus
    continuity at one point implies continuity at all points. Pretty interesting!
** Corollary
   Given a linear bounded operator $T$, it holds that 
   1. $x_n \rightarrow x$ implies that $Tx_n \rightarrow Tx$
   2. The null space of such an operator is closed
*** Proof
    These are basically properties of continuous functions.
** Definition
   We write that $T_1 = T_2$ if $D(T_1) = D(T_2)$ and $T_1x = T_2x$ for all $x
   \in D(T_1) = D(T_2)$. Furthermore $T\vert_B$ denotes the restriction to the
   set $B$, i.e., $T\vert_B \colon B \rightarrow Y$ with $T\vert_B x = Tx$ for
   all $x \in B$.

   The extension of $T$, denoted by $\tilde{T}\colon M \rightarrow Y$ where $D(T)
   \subset M$ is defined by $\tilde{T}x = Tx$, for all $x\in D(T)$.

   Example of extension. The set $X = Y = \R$, define $T$ by $Tx=x$, and $D(T) =
   [0, 1]. Then $\tilde{T}$ defined by $\tilde{T}x = \vert x \vert$ with
   $D(\tilde{T}) = [-1, 1]$ is an extension of $T$
** Theorem
   If $T \colon D(T) \rightarrow Y$ is a bounded linear operator, $D(T)$, part
   of a normed space, $Y$, a Banach space, then there is an extension
   $\tilde{T}\colon \bar{D(T)} \rightarrow Y$ with $\Vert \tilde{T} \Vert =
   \Vert T \Vert$. Furthermore, $\tilde{T}$ is a bounded linear operator.
*** Proof
    For any $x \in \bar{D}(T)$ consider the sequence $(x_n)_n$ in $D(T)$ that
    converges to $x$.

    $\Vert Tx_n - Tx_m \Vert = \Vert T(x_n - x_m)\Vert \le \Vert T \Vert \Vert
    x_n - x_m\Vert$. Since $x_m$ converges, $Tx_n$ is Cauchy and converges as we
    assumed $Y$ to be complete. The rest of the argument is trivial.
** Linear functionals
   A functional is a map from $X$ to $\R$ or $\C$. Given a functional $f$,
   $D(f)$ denotes the domain, $R(f)$ denotes the range of $f$. 

   For functionals, we typically write $f(x)$ and not $fx$, although $f$ is
   still an operator.
*** Example
    1. For a normed space $X$, $\Vert . \Vert \colon X \rightarrow \R$ is a functional.
    2. For $X=\R$, and $x_0 in X$, $f\colon X\rightarrow \R$, $x\mapsto x_0^{T}x
       = \langle x_0, x\rangle$.
    3. Linearity is defined as before, with the difference that $y$ is now $\R$
       if $X$ is a real or $\C$, if $X$ is a complex space.
*** Example
    1. The norm functional is not a linear functional. $\Vert \alpha x + \beta y
       \Vert \neq \alpha \Vert x \Vert + \beta \Vert y \Vert$. This is not true
       in general.
    2. Define $f(x) = x_0^{T}x$ is linear, clearly, because the scalar product
       is bilinear. It is linear in each variable.
    3. The evaluation functional given by the Dirac delta function $\delta_x f =
       f(x)$.
    4. The definite integral is a functional. Let $l$ denote the functional such
       that for $f$ in $C[a, b]$, $l(f) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$, then it is
       straightforward to verify that this is linear.
*** Remark
    Similarly, boundedness is again defined as: A linear functional is bounded
    if there exists a constant $c$ such that $\vert f(x) \vert \le c \cdot \Vert
    x \Vert$. and $\Vert v \Vert = \sup \vert f(x) \vert / \Vert x \Vert =
    \sup_{\Vert x \Vert = 1} \vert f(x) \vert$.
*** Theorem
    Let $f\colon D(f) \rightarrow K$ be a linear functional, then $f$ is
    continuous if and only if it is bounded.
*** Example
    1. For integrable functions on $[a, b]$, it is easy to see that the integral
       functional is bounded.
    2. The dot product example can be extended to $l_2$ by choosing a fixed
       element $a$ in $l_2$ and setting $f(x) = \sum a_i x_i$. Due to
       Cauchy-Schwarz inequality $\vert \langle x, y\rangle\vert \le \Vert x
       \Vert \cdot \Vert y \Vert$.

[fn:9] Idea of machine learning. We have two sets of points, we need to find a
function (often linear) that separates the points. But it may not be easy. So
one idea is to find a linear function to a higher dimensional space and then one
may be able to separate the points in the higher dimensional space.

[fn:8] These are called Kernels. But kernels in Machine learning is $k(x, y)
=\langle \phi(x), \phi(y)\rangle$, for example $h(x, y) = \exp(-\Vert x -
y\Vert/\varepsilon$ is called a Gaussian kernel. Another example is $h(x, y) =
(1+\langle x, y\rangle)^p$ polynomial kernel

[fn:7] This is an unbounded operator. We still haven't defined what bounded
operators are, though.

[fn:6] We might not need this property. 

[fn:5] The proof wasn't done in the class. But the idea is the all Cauchy
sequences converges.

[fn:4] This might be needed for the next exercises.

[fn:3] Is compactness needed?

[fn:2] Look up at proofs of this fact
